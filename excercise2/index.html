    <h2 class="bungee-regular">By Dieter Rams</h2>

    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design is innovative</b><br> The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.<br> Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design.<br> But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>
    
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design makes a product useful</b><br> A product is bought to be used.<br> It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic.<br> Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</P>
    
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design is aesthetic</b><br> The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being.<br> But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
   
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design makes a product understandable</b><br> It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product talk.<br> At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>
    
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design is unobtrusive</b><br> Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools.<br> They are neither decorative objects nor works of art.<br> Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</p>
    
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design is honest</b><br> It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is.<br> It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
    
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design is long-lasting</b><br> It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.<br> Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.</p>
    
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design is thorough down to the last detail</b><br> Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance.<br> Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.</p>
   
    <p class="story-script-regular"><b>Good design is environmentally-friendly</b><br> Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment.<br> It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>
